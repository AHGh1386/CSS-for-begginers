# 1.CSS Introduction:

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

## What are selectors

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

### Example:

```css
selector{
      background-color : red;
}
```


# 2.Ways to give style

## Inline

You can use the style attribute inside HTML elements.

## Internal 

You can use a <style> element in the <head> section.

## External

You can use <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

# 3.Selectors

## Type selectors:

you should use the type of your element.
For example if you wanna give style to paragraphs you can use `p`

```css

p{
   background-color : blue;
}
```

## id selector

yo should first give an id to the element that you want, then use the id with a # to give style to it.

For example if we wanna give style to `<p id="p1">Hello World</p>`

```css

#p1{
   color : green;
}
```
