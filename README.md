# 1.CSS Introduction:

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

## What are selectors

### Example:

```css
selector{
      background-color : red;
}
```
